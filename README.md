# Garmin-Timeline-Widget
Garmin Timeline Widget (v4)


Designed to replicate the beauty of the pebble timeline app, this garmin connect IQ project is planned to allow you to set a reminder, alarm, event and record (theres some overlap but I intend reminders to be for specific points in time, events fot the whole day, records to be kind of like memories and alarms to go off at a specific time every day, week, etc. Things may be subject to change in order to simplify things for lower end devices.
