# Garmin-Timeline-Widget
Garmin Timeline Widget (v4)


Designed to replicate the beauty of the pebble timeline app, this garmin connect IQ project is planned to allow you to set a reminder, alarm, event and record.
Things may be subject to change in order to simplify things for lower end devices. 

Upon opening the app you will be greeted with the timeline snapshot view, this is an indicator of your next item on the timeline, holding down on the screen or the 
"up" button on a non touchscreen watch takes you through to the main timeline view which shows you your next item on the timeline and the one after that. 

Holding down on the screen or holding the "up" button on a non touchscreen watch again opens up the menu to add an item to the timeline. For now you must type this in a specific format:
dd.mm.yyyy,hh:mm,description. So that could be 01.01.2024,10:25,new year. Certain words in the description of your item will activate a certain icon to be shown instead of the default, 
reminder,event,alarm and record icons, all custom made. 

Reminders: Temporary reminders for a specific date and time. Deleted after a day. (Great for one off reminders)

Alarms: Set it for a specific time for a certain day of the week, repeats every week. (Great for weekly or daily reminders) Requires manual deletion.

Records: Permanent reminders for a specific date and time. (Great for yearly reminders). (Requires manual deletion and remains in the past view until deleted).

Event: An all day reminder, the priority for a certain day. When the event is on it permanently stays in snapshot view. (Requires manual deletion).



Todo:


Within the main timeline screen you can press up or down or swipe up or down. Pressing/swiping up reveals your past items, after a few days past reminders and 
events will be removed automagically from this view (though perhaps there'll be an option to repeat them in the future) but not records, those are permanent memories you can type in to mark a significant milestone or event such as buying your first car or the collapse of 
society, brilliant to keep track of things long term and they'll pop up on the anniversary of that event (so long as you input the correct date). Of course as Garmin watches are not storage infinite 
there might have to be a limit on records, perhaps with a way to get them off the watch by storing them in settings.

Pressing "down or swiping down" on the main timeline view will show your future items, we'll so how many of those can be shown...I may include weather, sunset and sunrise to these future events at set times.
